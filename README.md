# ZDoom: Genwep
A very old project I worked on for ZDoom. It's a mix between a ton of different mods.

At the time, I had poor skill and little to no experience in modding. So please understand the low quality this "Mashup" has.

## Info

The main gameplay aspects you will see are some bug fixes for Led's Weapons and, most prominently, the Exosuit from Necrodoom. I had modified its arsenal to bear extra effects, like the Cannon ejecting a massive 20mm shell casing, or Smoke puffing out from the Minigun's barrels after firing.

But like I said, this is an old project (from 2019), so its quality is not up to my current standards.
